<div>In the context of supporting robust climate change impact assessment, two findings are emphasized:</div>
<ul>
  <li>The return periods associated with collapse are highly variable and are affected by collapse cause. This finding is not consistent with climate impact analyses that consider only one critical event (i.e., a 100-year flood).</li>
  <li>If this variability in collapse return periods is assumed to be representative of all in-service bridges, prior impact analyses have underestimated the change (positive or negative) in risk associated with climate change.</li>
</ul>
<div>Future research that is able to product more robust statistics on collapse return periods (e.g., by analyzing more than 35 bridges) can support more accurate estimation of climate change risk and impacts. Such an effort is underway using a larger database of geolocated bridge collapses.</div>
