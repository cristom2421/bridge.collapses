<div>The majority of US bridge collapses are <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CF.1943-5509.0000571">due to hydraulic (water-related) causes</a>. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of intense precipitation and alter patterns of flooding, potentially changing the risk of hydraulic collapse. Previous estimates of climate impacts have used various proxies for collapse, including precipitation and the assumptions underlying modern bridge design standards. These studies usually rely on point estimates, for example, that collapse occurs when a flood with a 100-year return period, T<sub>R</sub>, occurs. High-quality empirical data describing the intensity of flows causing collapse can be used to constrain climate impact assessments of bridge risk, which currently predict <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11027-011-9354-2">$140 billion to $250 billion in direct costs</a>, or <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29IS.1943-555X.0000109"> increased direct and indirect losses of 17%</a>.</div>
